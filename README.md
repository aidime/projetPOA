Dépôt du projet session hiver en Programmation Objet Avancée


Game tab :
	Browse the existing events and load them to have the full details, and to modify them at will. Roll the dices, choosing the number of dices and faces of the roll. Get Logs of your rolls, the events you call, or even custom logs by typing in the bottom text area !


Events tab :
	Create new events to be launched in the game tab (WARNING : event list update doesn't work properly, so we unfortunately can only display the dummy events created for testing that we left hardcoded for one to be able to test it out).


Players tab :
	Create new players and manage their SPECIAL points, their health, their initiative,or their level.


Notes : 
	This is an oversimplified version of what this project could be, for that reason, playersheets, events, or even dice rolls are extremely simple. This is a result of bad time management and way too big ambitions for this project, and we would like to apologize for that. 
	One could see the potential of such an app by imagining it on the internet, where players and GM's alike could interact with the app simultaneously, where we could use a database to hold data. The possibilities are great, but we lacked the time, and for some technicalities, the knowledge, to release the full potential of this project.
